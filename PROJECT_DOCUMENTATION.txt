1. OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------

The paint industry in India, particularly in metropolitan cities like Bengaluru, 
faces significant challenges in business management and operations:

• Fragmented Business Operations: Paint shops lack integrated systems to manage 
  inventory, sales, and customer relationships efficiently

• Manual Processes: Most paint businesses rely on paper-based records and manual 
  calculations, leading to errors and inefficiencies

• Limited Business Intelligence: Owners lack real-time insights into sales 
  trends, inventory levels, and customer preferences

• Multi-Role Complexity: Different stakeholders (owners, salespersons, 
  distributors) need different interfaces and functionalities

• Market Data Gap: Limited access to data-driven insights about local market 
  preferences and seasonal demands

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
------------------

The Rainbow Paint Business Management System aims to address these challenges 
by providing:

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Multi-Role Management System: Create specialized dashboards for Shop Owners, 
   Salespersons, and Distributors

2. Real-Time Business Analytics: Provide comprehensive sales, inventory, and 
   financial reporting

3. Efficient Point of Sale (POS): Streamline the sales process with digital 
   billing and inventory management

4. Data-Driven Insights: Leverage real Kaggle datasets with 1000+ customer 
   surveys and 10,000+ sales records

5. Bengaluru Market Focus: Specifically target the local Bengaluru paint market 
   with 6 strategic shop locations

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
• Implement modern web technologies for scalability and user experience
• Provide 3D interactive visualizations for better data comprehension
• Support Indian business practices (GST calculations, Rupee currency, local preferences)
• Create a foundation for future AI-powered features and mobile applications
